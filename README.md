# FlutterTask
This is a Flutter application that showcases users, their posts, comments, todos, and albums. The app demonstrates state management using Bloc, a clean architecture approach with dependency injection (GetIt), and API integration using the JSONPlaceholder API.

Features

Interactive Design

Modern and clean UI with gradient backgrounds.

Architecture
The app follows Clean Architecture principles and uses the Bloc Pattern for state management. Here’s a brief breakdown:

1. Presentation Layer
UI: Interactive and responsive screens for users, posts, todos, comments, and albums.
Bloc: Handles state management using flutter_bloc.
2. Domain Layer
Entities: Core business objects like UserEntity, PostEntity, TodoEntity, etc.
Use Cases: Handles business logic, e.g., fetching data or updating todos.
3. Data Layer
Repositories: Acts as an intermediary between the domain and data sources.
Data Sources: Handles API calls and caching using http and shared_preferences.
